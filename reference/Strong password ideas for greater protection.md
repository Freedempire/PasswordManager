# Strong password ideas for greater protection

Weak and easy-to-guess passwords make even the soundest cybersecurity strategy easy to bypass. If a hacker guesses or cracks a password, the intruder can access your account or system without raising the alarm and compromise whatever asset you kept safe behind a password.

The guide below provides 11 strong password ideas that will help you stay a step ahead of hackers. We also explain the difference between sound and weak passphrases, provide tips on improving current passwords, and show the main methods hackers rely on to crack credentials.

## How to Create a Strong Password

A strong password is a unique word or phrase a hacker cannot easily guess or crack. Here are the main traits of a reliable, secure password:

- At least 12 characters long (the longer, the better).
- Has a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation, and special symbols.
- Random and unique.

While complexity improves password security, length is the key characteristic. The best way to make a password strong is to make it long. For example, look at these two passwords:

- 89&^598
- ILoveMyCatLordStewart

While "89&^598" is entirely random, the first password is less secure than the second one. A password-cracking program could guess the "89&^598" in about 44 hours while cracking "ILoveMyCatLordStewart" would require 7 years of constant processing.

However, even the 7-years mark is not enough to call a password safe, which is why all strong password ideas below lead to phrases that take significantly longer to crack.

## The 4 Random Words Method

One of the simplest yet most effective strong password ideas is to throw 4 or more seemingly random words together. Just make sure that:

- The password is at least 12 characters long.
- The words do not have any natural flow to them (such as 'My Name Is Steven').
- You separate words with either spaces, punctuation, or special symbols.

Some examples of these passwords (and how to remember them) include:

- Phoenix Drive Cafe Office ("I work in Phoenix and drive by a cafe every day on my way to the office").
- Seattle, Kindle, Coffee, Planes ("Seattle is the birthplace of Amazon, Starbucks, and Boeing").
- Minnesota Airplane Boston Christmas ("I live in Minnesota but fly back home to Boston every Christmas").

The time needed to crack the "Phoenix Drive Cafe Office" password: 2 million years.

## Use an Entire Phrase

If you do not want to remember a random sequence of words, you can make a password out of a custom phase. Words within a phrase flow together better than random words and are easier to remember, but you should not rely on a famous saying or a quote.

You can decide whether to include spaces between the words (if the website accepts spaces within passwords). Here are a few good examples of custom phrases:

- You can actually use spaces in your password!
- Myboysareinthehighschoolbasketballteam
- I would prefer to go to Gryffindor pls

The time needed to crack the "You can actually use spaces in your password!" password: 4 hundred trillion years.

## Use a Custom Acronym

You can use an acronym to create a memorable yet effective password. For example, you can choose the phrase "My son was born at a Liverpool hospital in 2002" and take the first letter of each word (Mswb@aLhi2002) to create a solid and easy-to-remember password.

If you choose this method, ensure you are not basing the password on a common expression (such as "Tb,on2b,titq"). Here are some good ideas:

- IoaBMW,wa5782p. ("I own a BMW, with a 5782 plate.").
- H!Mnpintd2r! ("Hey! My new password is not that difficult to remember!").
- 2015wtyIbm1h. ("2015 was the year I bought my first house.").

The time needed to crack the "IoaBMW,wa5782p." password: 42 million years.

## Use the Keyboard Layout

Using the keyboard layout to create a custom pattern is another strong password idea. For example, you can remember something simple as a name (e.g., Jane Austen) and then use the keys above and to the right of the letters (Iwj4 W8e64j). Some good examples are:

- P05r 0t 6u4 %9jye ("Lord of the Rings").
- Y5wjr F4j65wp ^45k9jwp ("Grand Central Terminal").
- J43 &05o F4j65wp _w5o ("New York Central Park").

The time needed to crack the "P05r 0t 6u4 %9jye" password: 698 million trillion years.

## Make a Simple Formula

You can make up a custom formula to create a reliable password. For example, you can take any phrase and replace every letter with the next one in the alphabet:

- Cucumbers are tasty! -> Dvdvncfst bsf ubtuz! (time needed to crack: 762 billion trillion years)

You can also take the first letter of every word from the chorus of your favorite song:

- Mamma Mia chorus -> MmhIgammhcIrymmdisammjhmimy (time needed to crack: 129 million trillion years)

These examples may seem like gibberish, but that is exactly what you want to achieve.

## Vowel Switching

Take any phrase and replace one vowel with another (for example, A with E). As always, have at least 12 characters and use a random phrase for max protection:

"Every Monday, I wish it was Friday 🙁 " -> Every Mondey, I wish it wes Fridey : (
"I like a pub with an all-night open-bar policy" -> I like e pub with en ell-night open-ber policy
"I hammer nails, but nails hammer the board" -> I hemmer neils, but neils hemmer the boerd
The time needed to crack the "Every Mondey, I wish it wes Fridey : (" password: 307 million trillion years.

## Shorten Each Word

Pick a memorable phrase and remove the first three letters of every word (do not worry if the process deletes the entire word):

- "Workdays are for work, but weekends are for football!" -> kdays k, kends tball!
- "Thursdays are great, but Fridays are better" -> rsdays at, days tter
- "Basketball is my favorite sport after hockey" -> ketball orite rt er key

The time needed to crack the "kdays k, kends tball!" password: 184 billion years.

## Mix the ISO Codes of Favorite Countries

This fun yet strong password idea requires you to list the ISO codes of your favorite countries or counties you visited (that way, you can update your password every time you visit a new nation). You will get something like this:

- "Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Japan" -> can mex fra deu jpn

The time needed to crack the "can mex fra deu jpn" password: 424 trillion years

## The Math Method

You can use mathematical symbols and equations to create a strong password. These passwords are typically long and full of different symbols, making them an ideal passphrase choice. Some examples are:

- MyDog+MyCat=8legs
- 830-630=TwoHundred
- Children+Xmas=Presents

The time needed to crack the "MyDog+MyCat=8legs" password: 9 million years.

## Use a Deliberate Misspelling

You can intentionally misspell words to create unique and secure passwords such as:

- SuperrmenHatseCryptoss
- KryingTeers2Nite
- ILovDoubluMcBurgurs

The time needed to crack the "SuperrmenHatseCryptos" password: 119 million years.

If you decide to use this method, be careful not to use common misspellings (such as "acommodate"). Hackers feed cracking programs with password lists with all usual wording errors, so the more obscure your password is, the better.

## Customise your passwords for specific accounts

Once you’ve come up with a strong password that you can remember, you’ll still have to create different passwords for each of your online accounts. But, rather than starting the whole process again, you could simply add a different code into your password for each online account.

So, for example, if your password was "cHb1%pXAuFP8" and you wanted to make it unique for your eBay account, you could add "£bay" on the end so you know it’s different to your original password but still memorable.

Here’s how that could work:

|Online account|Password with added code|
|---|---|
|Email|cHb1%pXAuFP8EMa1l|
|Amazon|cHb1%pXAuFP8AZN|
|eBay|cHb1%pXAuFP8£Bay|

## What to Avoid when Choosing a Password

You should follow a strict set of rules when choosing passwords to avoid weaknesses a hacker can exploit. A strong password should never:

- Have less than 12 characters.
- Be solely based on personal data (name, surname, family member's name, date of birth, workplace, favorite sports club, etc.).
- Contain memorable keyboard paths (most notably qwerty and asdfgh).
- Solely use letters, symbols, or numbers.
- Be re-used across two (or more) different accounts or websites (even if the password is strong, one of the websites keeping the password might have a breach and place all other accounts in danger).
- Include sequential letters or numbers.
- Be based on a common word (in any language).
- Rely on basic character substitution for security (such as "M@nch3st3rUtd" or "L3tM31n").
- Contain the corresponding username.
